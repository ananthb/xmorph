// newIdleCmd exposes "do nothing, stay alive" as a real program rather than a
// pivot mode.
//
// A remote rescue pivot has no program to run: the point is to reach the box
// over SSH while its disk is free. Something still has to occupy the
// entrypoint, because when the entrypoint exits there is no init left and
// xmorph reboots into the on-disk OS.
//
// `sleep infinity` fills that role on a normal system but needs coreutils, and
// a bare shell exits immediately once detached. xmorph copies its own binary
// into every pivoted rootfs, so this subcommand is always available no matter
// how minimal the image — alpine, busybox, distroless alike:
//
//	xmorph pivot --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/xmorph --cmd idle --ssh.enable

than execution. xmorph places its own binary at ` + postpivot.BinaryPath + ` in
